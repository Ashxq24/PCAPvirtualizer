# PCAPvirtualizer
This is a python program to visualize a pcap file based on different levels like:
  1.Device Level topology
  2.IP level topology
  3.TCP/UDP level topology

This is built using various python modules like: networkx,itertools,graphviz

note: Currently this program efficiently working for pcap file size of less than 100kb. I will try to optimize it in future
